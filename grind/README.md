# What is CSS Grid?
CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. Unlike Flexbox, which is one-dimensional **(handling layouts in rows or columns)**, Grid allows for layouts in both rows and columns simultaneously. 

With CSS Grid, you can easily create flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and content needs.

## Basic Grid Terminology
1. Grid Container: The parent element where Grid is applied. This is the element that uses display: grid;.

2. Grid Items: The direct children of the Grid container. Each item in the grid will follow the grid layout rules.

3. Grid Lines: The lines that create the boundaries of each row or column.

4. Grid Tracks: The space between two grid lines (essentially a column or row).

5. Grid Cell: The smallest individual unit in a grid, defined by the intersection of a row and column.

6. Grid Area: A section that spans multiple cells to create a larger “area” within the grid.
